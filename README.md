    - `place_id`, `rank`, `ratio1`, `ratio2`, `ratio3`, `number_of_agents`, `number_of_pubs`, `etc.`
1. Run the simulation with different parameters ***DONE Feb 05, 2024 by Hossein*** 
1. See their impact on the results to use the parameters to calculate the ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 variables.
1. Implement away to calculate the ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 variables inside the worldModel.
